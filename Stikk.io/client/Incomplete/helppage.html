	<h2>Earning Money</h2>
	<p class="paragraph">Defeat players to take their money and upgrade your equipment. Defeating a player will give you half of their total value. If there are no players, destroy shapes to gain money. The more sides a shape has, the more money it gives you. However, more valuable shapes also have more health. </p>
