*********For loader:
Keep the simloader, just add needed images up top.

*********For server:

Hopefully can copy all stats and stuff, using CALC COPY comments
replace everything above the socket.on's, make sure glue works
all the `on` stuff is not needed, server does not need to respond to client requests
require present change to: var present = function () { return performance.now() };
put these in main update loop:
    aiGetChoices(playerA,playerB);
    aiGetChoices(playerB,playerA);

const maplimitx = 3000;
const maplimity = 1800;

Put this in redirect to update
    if (state == "sim") { 
        update();
        if(maxSpeed){
            for(var i=0;i<100;i++){
                update();
            }
        }
        

    };
add to kill function:
    maxSpeed=false;
    if (killer.chealth>0) {
        winnerElem.innerHTML = "Player " + killer.name + " won. They had " + killer.chealth + " health left.";
    } else {
        winnerElem.innerHTML = "Both players killed the other.";
    }
*********For game:
rip out anything with socket emits in it, don't need to talk to server. Also remove DOM event handlers.
replace with cli_ version
    obs
    projs 
    players 
    otherObjects
remove drawminimap, drawborders. uicanvas, mobile, uicanvas
set 
    function drawGrid(ctx) {
        ctx.strokeStyle = '#000000';
        //ctx.beginPath();
        xx = -campos[0] % 1500
        yy = -campos[1] % 900

        ctx.drawImage(bgrid, xx, yy);
        if (campos[0] < mapw - 1500) {
            ctx.drawImage(bgrid, xx + 1500, yy);
        }
        if (campos[1] < maph - 900) {
            ctx.drawImage(bgrid, xx, yy + 900);
        }
        if (campos[1] < maph - 900 && campos[0] < mapw - 1500) {
            ctx.drawImage(bgrid, xx + 1500, yy + 900);
        }

        ctx.stroke();
    }
var campos = [0, 0];
keep only relevant socket ons from gameStartHandlers, call it immediately.
get rid of removegamehandlers
fiddle out all kinds of other small bits
change rotate_point to cli_rotate_point
health change needs updateHealthDisplay(p)
